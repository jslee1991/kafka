Configures automatic restarts for connectors and tasks that are in a `FAILED` state.

When enabled, a back-off algorithm applies the automatic restart to each failed connector and its tasks.

The operator attempts an automatic restart on reconciliation. 
If the first attempt fails, the operator makes up to six more attempts. 
The duration between each restart attempt increases from 2 to 30 minutes.
After each restart, failed connectors and tasks transit from `FAILED` to `RESTARTING`.
If the restart fails after the final attempt, there is likely to be a problem with the connector configuration. 
The connector and tasks remain in a `FAILED` state and you have to restart them manually.
You can do this by annotating the `KafKaConnector` custom resource with `strimzi.io/restart: "true"`.

For Kafka Connect connectors, use the `autoRestart` property of the `KafkaConnector` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.

For MirrorMaker 2, use the `autoRestart` property of connectors in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.
