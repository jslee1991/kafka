= Monitoring operators using Prometheus metrics

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi operators expose Prometheus metrics.
The metrics are automatically enabled and contain information about the following:

* Number of reconciliations
* Number of Custom Resources the operator is processing
* Duration of reconciliations
* JVM metrics from the operators

Additionally, Strimzi provides xref:ref-metrics-dashboards-{context}[an example Grafana dashboard for the operator].
