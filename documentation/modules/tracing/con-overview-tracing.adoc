Use OpenTelemetry or OpenTracing (deprecated) with the Jaeger tracing system.

OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing provide API specifications that are independent from the tracing or monitoring system.

You use the APIs to instrument application code for tracing. 

* Instrumented applications generate _traces_ for individual requests across the distributed system.

* Traces are composed of _spans_ that define specific units of work over time.

Jaeger is a tracing system for microservices-based distributed systems.

* Jaeger implements the tracing APIs and provides client libraries for instrumentation.

* The Jaeger user interface allows you to query, filter, and analyze trace data.
