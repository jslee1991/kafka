= Downgrading Strimzi

[role="_abstract"]
If you are encountering issues with the version of Strimzi you upgraded to,
you can revert your installation to the previous version.

If you used the YAML installation files to install Strimzi, you can use the YAML installation files from the previous release to perform the following downgrade procedures:

. xref:proc-downgrade-cluster-operator-{context}[]
. xref:assembly-downgrade-kafka-versions-{context}[]

If the previous version of Strimzi does not support the version of Kafka you are using,
you can also downgrade Kafka as long as the log message format versions appended to messages match.

WARNING: The following downgrade instructions are only suitable if you installed Strimzi using the installation files. 
If you installed Strimzi using another method, like {OperatorHub}, downgrade may not be supported by that method unless specified in their documentation. 
To ensure a successful downgrade process, it is essential to use a supported approach.
